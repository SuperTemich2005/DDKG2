			</npc_ai>
			//THE ORDER IN WHICH AIs ARE ADDED TO THE NPC IS IMPORTANT.
			//BECAUSE IF SOME AI TAKES CONTROL OF THE NPC OTHER AIs WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT.
			//FOR EXAMPLE: In this current set up we have 4 AIs added to our NPC: Life support, Fireman, Repairman and Worker.
			//So Every server update(tick)(by default its 40times/second) We will go through all AIs and see which one takes control of the NPC during this server update(tick).
			//First we have the Lifesupport - it checks if our npc needs to go heal up or replenish O2. Let's say he doesn't.
			//Then we continue to the next AI in the list: Fireman - it checks if there are any Fires on the ship, let's say there are none.
			//Then we get to the repairman AI, it checks for any damaged systems on the ship, let's say that our Shields sys is damaged,
			//The Repairman AI tries to take control of th NPC and send him to repair the Shields system. First it tries to find a path for our NPC to get to that system.
			//If it can not find a path to the damaged system then it will not take control of the NPC, let's say that we do find a path.
			//Then the Repairman AI takes control and our NPC is sent to the Shields system to repair it.
			//Now the next AI in the list - Worker AI will not even be allowed to try to take control of the NPC because it was take earlier by the Repairman AI.
			//So the next server update we again start from the top - Again Lifesupport doesn't need to take control(NPC is still at full HP and O2), Fireman also skips(Still no fires on the ship)
			//Repairman AI still sees that broken Shields system, but it also sees that our NPC already has a path set to follow. So it just sends him on his way.
			//And the Worker AI again doesn't get the chance to take control.
			//And so it continues untill our NPC arrives to the Shields system.
			//Now the path is finished, and our Repairman AI sees that the room our NPC is in has a damaged system, so it tells our NPC to repair it.
			//Now let's suppose that while repairing the Shields system, We suddenly get a fire started in our Engines room.
			//What will happen? Will our NPC continue reparing the system or will he stop repairing and go for the Fire?
			//Next server update We again start from the top of the AI list and see that our Life support is still not needed (NPS is still at full HP and O2).
			//Next AI in the list is the Fireman, but this time we do have a fire on our ship. So the Fireman AI will now take control, and send our NPC to the nearest fire to put it our.
			//Now let's suppose that our NPC got to the fire and started to put it our, and while doing so he lost so much HP that it is now under 30%.
			//What will happen is that next server update our Lifesupport AI will take control of the NPC and will try to send it to the nearest med bay.
			//But let's suppose that there is no working med bay - or rather there is a med bay, it is not damaged, but it's not powered.
			//In this case Lifesupport AI will not take control of the NPC, and so it will skip it's turn at controlling the NPC this server update.
			//Next one is the Fireman AI which will continue telling the NPC to put out the fires.
			//Let's say that to our luck, our NPC managed to put out the fires before burning to death. So now there are no more fires on the ship.
			//So next server update our NPC will be controlled by the Repairman AI because we still have those broken shields to repair - remember :)
			//NPC will be sent to the shields room, ther he will again start repairing the shields.
			//Now let's pretend that while reparing the shields for the second time - some smart guy Captain - remembered that he has his med bay powered down, he went there and powered it back up.
			//What will happen is that since our NPC is still at low HP, next server update the Lifesupport AI will take control, because it no does have a path to a working med bay.
			//So once again our NPC will stop repairing the Shileds and go for the med bay to get some HP back.
			//NPC will syat in the medbay untill he has full hp, and then when Lifesupport no longer takes control of our NPC, no fires present, 
			//The Repairman AI will send our NPC to repair the shields again.
			//Now when the shields are repaired, and there are no more damaged systems or breaches on the ship, there are no fires, HP is above 30% O2 is above 20%
			//Then there is no work for the Lifesupport, Fireman, or Repairman, AIs
			//So the Worker AI will finally get the chance to take control of the NPC.
			//And what it will do is that it will send the NPC to work(just visually) at a random system(<npc_ai_param>SYSTEMS=WEAPONS_CONTROL:SHIELDS:PILOTING</npc_ai_param>)
			//Where he will work for (<npc_ai_param>WORK_TIME=90</npc_ai_param>) seconds.
			//And then to another one and so on endlessly. The Worker AI always takes contorl of the NPC when he get's the chance. So make sure that it is last one in the AI list.
			//Now if youo would have put the Lifesupport AI second one in the list after the Fireman - then NPC would never go healing or replenishing O2 untill there are no fires on the ship that he can put out.
